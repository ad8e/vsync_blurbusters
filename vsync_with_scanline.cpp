	//there is noise in both the timepoint and scanline measurement.
	//todo: there is no noise in the timepoint. all the noise is in the scanline measurement. thus, our linear regression is wrong
	//should it should regress with time as the independent variable, even though we want to minimize time error? that would minimize error in the noisy variable. which makes more sense. but then the predicted variable might be slightly wrong?

	//naively, independent variable should be scanline. because it takes in a scanline, outputs a time, and you want the time to have the least error.
	//but linear regression is inherently flawed in the presence of a noisy independent variable
	//"Weak exogeneity. This essentially means that the predictor variables x can be treated as fixed values, rather than random variables. This means, for example, that the predictor variables are assumed to be error-freeâ€”that is, not contaminated with measurement errors. Although this assumption is not realistic in many settings, dropping it leads to significantly more difficult errors-in-variables models."
